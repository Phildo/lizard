  "NAME once ate four potatoes in a single sitting. Given the size of lizards compared to the size of potatoes, this is quite the incredible feat. In fact, it's probably not true, come to think of it. NAME is a liar.",
  "NAME loves licking his own eyeballs. But then again, NAME is a lizard. So really, what do you expect. I'm not really sure why lizards do that. I'm not one to judge.",
  "A typical day in the life of NAME consists of: Laying on hot rocks. Eating things. Flies? Maybe? Uh. Sleeping? Lizards sleep, right? Yeah, of course. Finding shade when too hot. Et cetera.",
  "NAME owns an impressive plot of land in the desert. Probably her most prized posession. NAME spends her days tending to this land- making sure everything is in order. Good on you, NAME.",
  "NAME has insecurities, sure. But don't we all? \"Oh, look at NAME's nostrils. Aren't they tiny!\" You should be ashamed of yourselves, saying such hurtful things.",
  "What. A. GORGEOUS Lizard. My gosh. Just look at this lizard. NAME is beautiful and NAME knows it. Those eyes. That tail. Wow.",
  "There is legend that has fortold the coming of a lizard so powerful as to shake the foundations upon which modern lizard society sit. This lizard, however, is pretty average. You do you, NAME.",
  "NAME dreams of one day becoming a lizard. Good news, because NAME has already acheived just that. And really, isn't that what it's all about? Accepting you for YOU.",
  "NAME likes Death Metal. I know. Caught me off guard too.",
  "NAME is just happy you like her.",
  "NAME just wanted to meet a friendly mate at the local hot rock, but he considered a bit to fast. Now he runs for you. Sad, I know.",
  "There comes a day in every young lizard's life when they must step upon the rock and become an adult. Every lizard prepares for this day through their entire childhood. Today was NAME's day. You took that from her. You don't care though, do you?",
